Just some simple tutorials to understand React a little better. 

React:
    1. React is a JavaScript library
    2. React is not a framework
    3. React is an open-source project created by Facebook
    4. React is used to build user interfaces (UI) on the front end
    5. React is the view layer of an MVC application (Model View Controller)

One of the most important aspects of React is the fact that you can create components, which are like custome, reusable HTML elements, to quickly
and efficiently build user interfaces. Reat also streamlines how data is stored and handled, using state and props.
